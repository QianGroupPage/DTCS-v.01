# Phonopy-lblcrn.SpectroscoPy

Phonopy-lblcrn.SpectroscoPy is a project to add the capability to simulate vibrational spectra to the Phonopy code.[[1](#Ref1)]

The software package consists of a Python module, `lblcrn.SpectroscoPy`, along with a set of command-line scripts for working with output from Phonopy and VASP.


## Features

* Calculate infrared (IR) intensities from Phonopy or VASP calculations.

* Calculate Raman-activity tensors and scalar-averaged intensities within the far-from-resonance approximation.

* Prepare peak tables including assigning modes to irreducible representations (Phonopy interface).

* Output customisable simulated spectra with support for multiple unit systems and simulated instrumental broadening.

* Include first-principles mode linewidths from Phono3py[[2](#Ref2)] calculations (Phonopy interface).


## Installation

The code depends on the `NumPy`[[3](#Ref3)] and `PyYAML`[[4](#Ref4)] packages, and the Phonopy interface additionally requires the `Phonopy` Python library[[1](#Ref1)] and the H5py package.[[5](#Ref5)]
All four packages are available from PyPI (via `pip`) and on the Anaconda platform (`conda`).
Please see the documentation of the codes for instructions on how to install them on your system.

This code does not currently ship with a `setup.py` script.
After cloning or downloading and unpacking the repository, add it to your `PYTHONPATH` so that the command-line scripts can locate `lblcrn.SpectroscoPy`, e.g.:

`export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/Volumes/Data/Repositories/Phonopy-lblcrn.SpectroscoPy`

The command-line scripts are in the [Scripts](./Scripts) directory.
For convenience, you may wish to add this folder to your `PATH` variable, e.g.:

`export PATH=${PATH}:/Volumes/Data/Repositories/Phonopy-lblcrn.SpectroscoPy/Scripts`

For a description of the command-line arguments the scripts accept, call them with the `-h` option, e.g.:

`phonopy-ir -h`

2. [&alpha;-SiO<sub>2</sub>](./Examples/a-SiO2): Detailed simulation of the IR and Raman spectra of &alpha;-SiO<sub>2</sub> (quartz) using the Phonopy interface, including first-principles linewidths calculated using Phono3py, compared to spectra from the RRUFF database
